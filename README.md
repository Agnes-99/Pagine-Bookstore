## ✨ Our Story

Founded in 2024 by **M.A. Mabusela**, Pagine Bookstore began as a passion project inspired by a love for literature and a desire to create a haven for book lovers. The idea was sparked during a long flight while reading Sarah J. Maas' *A Court of Thorns and Roses*. Immersed in its magical world, I realized the transformative power of stories and set out to share that magic with others.
